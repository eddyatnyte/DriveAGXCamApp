# Multi-Camera Control on NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin

This project demonstrates the setup and control of a four-camera system using the NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin platform. The cameras used are GMSL cameras, all connected to Port B of the Drive AGX Orin.

## Features
- Real-time video streaming from four cameras.
- Automatic initialization without the need for user input.
- Simple runtime control: Press a key to terminate the application.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin platform.
- Four GMSL cameras connected to Port B.
- Pre-configured development environment for the Drive AGX Orin.

## Usage
1. Connect the GMSL cameras to Port B on the NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin.
2. Compile and run the application on the Drive AGX Orin.
3. The application starts automatically without requiring input.
4. Press any key during runtime to stop the application.

## Notes
This setup provides a foundation for further development in applications such as real-time video processing, image stitching, or panoramic view generation.
